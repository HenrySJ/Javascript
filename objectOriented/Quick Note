Object-oriented Programing (OOP) is a programing paradigm centered around objects rather than functions.
 * Benefits of OOP *

 1. Encapsulation: Reduce complexity + increase reusability
 2. Abtraction: Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes
 3. Inheritance: Eliminate redundant code
 4. Polymorphism: Refactor ugly switch/case statements
